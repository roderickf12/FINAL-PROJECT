     On a recent day at The Grill Studios in Emeryville, LOE Gino is talking about his upbringing in West Berkeley and his love 
     for Seattle. <br>
     
     A few moments into the conversation, while reflecting on his childhood, the rapper <br>
     cuts himself off mid-sentence and says, <br> “Blood really didn’t pick my family.
     It was just circumstances.”  <br>
     It is just this type of personal reflection that has helped LOE Gino develop a loyal fanbase throughout the Bay Area and 
     Pacific Northwest. <br> He gives his fans the opportunity to get to know <br> him as an artist through lyrical 
     reflections that touch on topics such as <br> family loss, fatherhood and Black identity.
